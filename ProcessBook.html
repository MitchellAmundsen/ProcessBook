		<h2>Coping With Blindness</h2>
		<ul>
			<li class="writingFont">This video features a girl that went blind a little over a year ago and her explaining many aspects of that process.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">The video is mainly about the transition from being able to see to being blind. It also highlights the difference between transitioning to blindness compared to just being blind. </li>
			<li class="writingFont">Emotionally the girl describes the sadness of not being able to experience a lot of the things he used to love doing. She talks about how the depression and despair that she would feel.  Socially she talks about the encounters she would have with friends, like crying in front of them.  Her friends all moved onto college, while she has to repeat grade 13 because of time lost.  Most of the challenges described were mental challenges and the process of coping with this huge change. </li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Architecture for Death and Dying</h2>
		<ul>
			<li class="writingFont">The video is a TED talk about architecture and its relation to death.  It takes a look at the bland and depressing layout of the modern hospital and how our perception of death shapes that.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">I believe there are a few transitions. One of the transitions is on an individual level.  Helping individuals transition into the latter parts of their life and making death an better experience is one transition.  Our societies transition from a shy perspective of death to more open and fun viewpoints is another transition. </li>
			<li class="writingFont">Physical, emotional, and social challenges are a part of this problem space. The physical aspect is the buildings. Hospitals are built to preserve life, but this creates a problem with the inevitability of death.  Our hospitals are physically unattractive and this makes the process of death more difficult. The emotional challenge is just the emotional impact that death has on an individual, coupled with the look of the hospital.  Social challenges are the greatest in this problem space.  People are too afraid to talk about death and it is taboo subject.  Being able to discuss how to make death easier is necessary to solve the problem.</li>

		<h3>Console Gamer to PC Gamer</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="writingFont">Playing games primarily on an Xbox 360 was the starting state. Once I got my PC I started playing primarily on the computer, but used Steam exclusively. Now I know what my computer is capable of playing and where to get the best deals on games, which is the final state.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">Now I am capable of playing a wider variety of games at much lower prices. Just better options overall.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">Building the PC was a stressful part of the transition. Not knowing much about PCs and relying on people to give me advice made the transition difficult. Learning about all of the resources and benefits was the hardest and longest part of the transition.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">Knowing about all the different websites with various deals would have improved the transition. If there was a centralized site that compared deals and gave information about different specs and parts would have made the learning process smoother.</li>

		</ul>
		<h3>Living With Parents to Living by Yourself</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="writingFont">I think the beginning and end state are pretty clear cut. The beginning state was living with and relying on my parents. My end state would be living by myself and being responsible with the chores that are involved.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">More freedom and a sense of pride are the direct benefits of living by yourself.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">It was challenging adjusting to various aspects of home living. Washing dishes, doing chores, and just being responsible overall were the most challenging parts. Looking for a place to live was also an aspect that proved to be more challenging than previously thought.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">There is no system that teaches you about all the tasks a individual needs to complete when living by themselves. This includes chores, rent, cooking, and much more.</li>
			<img src=""/>
		</ul>
		<h3>Highschool to Running Start</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="writingFont">Going to highschool full time was the beginning state, while going to community college was the end state. An in between state would be partial running start, but in my case this was the end state.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">Free college credits is the obvious benefit, but getting adjusted to a college environment and work load was also an added benefit.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">Getting used to the social situation was the most challenging aspect. It felt that I was missing out on the high school experience. Community college social environment is also very introverted, and although I didn't mind, it was very different than high school.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">An easy resource for running start students to connect would be helpful for some. I had a friend that I took classes with, but I know some that are afraid of the social situation. Having easier access to counselors would also be helpful, since knowing what classes to take isn't obvious as a running start student.</li>

		</ul>
		<h3>Home Workout to Gym</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="writingFont">The beginning state was working out at home with dumbbells and non-weight based exercises. An intermediate state was being at the gym but only using a select few machines. Knowing what machines to use and having a routine is an appropriate end state.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">Being able to use all of the different machines and efficiently workout more specific muscle groups was the main benefit of the gym.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">Being embarrassed of working out in front of others was a huge challenge. Learning about the different machines was also challenging. Nobody wants to look like they don't know what they are doing, so many people stick with the machines they know.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">A system that shows you which machines to use based on what you want to workout would be helpful. A friendlier atmosphere with fewer stigmas on working out would make the transition easier.</li>
			<img src=""/>
		</ul>
		<h3>Car to Bus Transportation</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="writingFont">Car driving was the beginning state. A middle state was being able to use the buses, but having to plan ahead of time. My end state is understanding and remembering the different options I have for different locations I commonly use.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">Not having to pay for gas or find parking in a city environment are the benefits of transitioning to the bus.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">Missing the bus was a big challenge. It was hard to know whether or not the bus had passed already and which bus would be the most efficient for getting to my destination on time. Learning all the bus option in my area was another challenging aspect.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">A phone application that helped keep track of where buses were and approximate when they would arrive would help me get to my destination on time better. A more improved and united version of the apps currently available would make everyday transportation much easier.</li>

			<h3>Wii U</h3>
			<img class="img4" src="img/9ynp-800.jpg"/>
			<p class="container para4">The Wii U is a gaming console that uses both digital and physical technology very well. Utilizing motion, touchscreen, and camera technology, the Wii U's gamepad is one of the most versatile gaming controllers on the market. It is used by gamers of all ages, with the primary audience being teenagers. Games are the digital content, with downloadable and disk games available. Physicallity exists in the controllers, allowing players to play the game with more physicality than just a thumbstick.</p>

			<h3>iPhone 6S</h3>
			<img class="img4" src="img/3D-Touch-Cydia-Tweak.jpg"/>
			<p class="container para4">3D touch is a very physical aspect of the brand new iPhone. Now the touch screen is more than just tapping. How hard you press on the phone's touchscreen will change how the phone reacts. This adds more of a physical way to interact with all the digital aspects of the phone. Various applications are the digital part of the phone, but the physical part belongs to the 3D touch.</p>

			<h3>New Crosswalk Button</h3>
			<img class="img4" src="img/buttons-with-feedback.jpg"/>
			<p class="container para4">Seattle has recently implemented new crosswalk systems in the more populated areas of the city. The digital aspect of the crosswalk has stayed the same, with an algorithim determining when the crosswalk is available. However, the button has changed to have more physical feedback. Sound and vibrating feedback occurs when the user pushes the button, allowing the user to know when their input is received. This creates a very necesarry physical feedback for people of all kinds.</p>

		<div class="container">
			<h3>Google Maps (phone directions)</h3>
			<img class="img4" src="img/maxresdefault.jpg"/>
			<p class="container para4">Google Maps has a very in depth digital part of its application. It has various algorithims to compute traffic and time, as well as a very complex representation of the map. Our position is very physical, and helps keep google up to date. Moving down the street or even turning the phone will update the digital display.</p>

		<div class="container">
			<h3>Oculus Rift</h3>
			<img class="img4" src="img/The-Oculus-Rift-headset-i-010.jpg"/>
			<p class="container para4">Virtual reality in gaming is the next big thing, and it is attempting to bridge the gap between our physical world and the digital world of the games. The universe that the game takes place is the digital aspect. How the Oculus Rift takes the users movement and turns are the physical part of the device. Users now feel as if they are actually in the game world, a very perfect example of physical and digital designs.</p>
