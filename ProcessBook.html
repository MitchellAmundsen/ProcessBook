		<h2>Coping With Blindness</h2>
		<ul>
			<li class="writingFont">This video features a girl that went blind a little over a year ago and her explaining many aspects of that process.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">The video is mainly about the transition from being able to see to being blind. It also highlights the difference between transitioning to blindness compared to just being blind. </li>
			<li class="writingFont">Emotionally the girl describes the sadness of not being able to experience a lot of the things he used to love doing. She talks about how the depression and despair that she would feel.  Socially she talks about the encounters she would have with friends, like crying in front of them.  Her friends all moved onto college, while she has to repeat grade 13 because of time lost.  Most of the challenges described were mental challenges and the process of coping with this huge change. </li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Architecture for Death and Dying</h2>
		<ul>
			<li class="writingFont">The video is a TED talk about architecture and its relation to death.  It takes a look at the bland and depressing layout of the modern hospital and how our perception of death shapes that.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">I believe there are a few transitions. One of the transitions is on an individual level.  Helping individuals transition into the latter parts of their life and making death an better experience is one transition.  Our societies transition from a shy perspective of death to more open and fun viewpoints is another transition. </li>
			<li class="writingFont">Physical, emotional, and social challenges are a part of this problem space. The physical aspect is the buildings. Hospitals are built to preserve life, but this creates a problem with the inevitability of death.  Our hospitals are physically unattractive and this makes the process of death more difficult. The emotional challenge is just the emotional impact that death has on an individual, coupled with the look of the hospital.  Social challenges are the greatest in this problem space.  People are too afraid to talk about death and it is taboo subject.  Being able to discuss how to make death easier is necessary to solve the problem.</li>
