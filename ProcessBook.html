		<h2>Coping With Blindness</h2>
		<ul>
			<li class="writingFont">This video features a girl that went blind a little over a year ago and her explaining many aspects of that process.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">The video is mainly about the transition from being able to see to being blind. It also highlights the difference between transitioning to blindness compared to just being blind. </li>
			<li class="writingFont">Emotionally the girl describes the sadness of not being able to experience a lot of the things he used to love doing. She talks about how the depression and despair that she would feel.  Socially she talks about the encounters she would have with friends, like crying in front of them.  Her friends all moved onto college, while she has to repeat grade 13 because of time lost.  Most of the challenges described were mental challenges and the process of coping with this huge change. </li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Architecture for Death and Dying</h2>
		<ul>
			<li class="writingFont">The video is a TED talk about architecture and its relation to death.  It takes a look at the bland and depressing layout of the modern hospital and how our perception of death shapes that.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">I believe there are a few transitions. One of the transitions is on an individual level.  Helping individuals transition into the latter parts of their life and making death an better experience is one transition.  Our societies transition from a shy perspective of death to more open and fun viewpoints is another transition. </li>
			<li class="writingFont">Physical, emotional, and social challenges are a part of this problem space. The physical aspect is the buildings. Hospitals are built to preserve life, but this creates a problem with the inevitability of death.  Our hospitals are physically unattractive and this makes the process of death more difficult. The emotional challenge is just the emotional impact that death has on an individual, coupled with the look of the hospital.  Social challenges are the greatest in this problem space.  People are too afraid to talk about death and it is taboo subject.  Being able to discuss how to make death easier is necessary to solve the problem.</li>

		<h3>Console Gamer to PC Gamer</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="writingFont">Playing games primarily on an Xbox 360 was the starting state. Once I got my PC I started playing primarily on the computer, but used Steam exclusively. Now I know what my computer is capable of playing and where to get the best deals on games, which is the final state.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">Now I am capable of playing a wider variety of games at much lower prices. Just better options overall.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">Building the PC was a stressful part of the transition. Not knowing much about PCs and relying on people to give me advice made the transition difficult. Learning about all of the resources and benefits was the hardest and longest part of the transition.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">Knowing about all the different websites with various deals would have improved the transition. If there was a centralized site that compared deals and gave information about different specs and parts would have made the learning process smoother.</li>
			<img class="imgp3" src="img/wscLiCX.png"/>
		</ul>
		<h3>Living With Parents to Living by Yourself</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="writingFont">I think the beginning and end state are pretty clear cut. The beginning state was living with and relying on my parents. My end state would be living by myself and being responsible with the chores that are involved.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">More freedom and a sense of pride are the direct benefits of living by yourself.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">It was challenging adjusting to various aspects of home living. Washing dishes, doing chores, and just being responsible overall were the most challenging parts. Looking for a place to live was also an aspect that proved to be more challenging than previously thought.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">There is no system that teaches you about all the tasks a individual needs to complete when living by themselves. This includes chores, rent, cooking, and much more.</li>
			<img class="imgp3" src="img/piled-up-dishes-in-kitchen-sink.jpg"/>
		</ul>
		<h3>Highschool to Running Start</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="writingFont">Going to highschool full time was the beginning state, while going to community college was the end state. An in between state would be partial running start, but in my case this was the end state.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">Free college credits is the obvious benefit, but getting adjusted to a college environment and work load was also an added benefit.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">Getting used to the social situation was the most challenging aspect. It felt that I was missing out on the high school experience. Community college social environment is also very introverted, and although I didn't mind, it was very different than high school.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">An easy resource for running start students to connect would be helpful for some. I had a friend that I took classes with, but I know some that are afraid of the social situation. Having easier access to counselors would also be helpful, since knowing what classes to take isn't obvious as a running start student.</li>
			<img class="imgp3" src="img/Shoreline_CC_Foss_Building_01.jpg"/>
		</ul>
		<h3>Home Workout to Gym</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="writingFont">The beginning state was working out at home with dumbbells and non-weight based exercises. An intermediate state was being at the gym but only using a select few machines. Knowing what machines to use and having a routine is an appropriate end state.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">Being able to use all of the different machines and efficiently workout more specific muscle groups was the main benefit of the gym.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">Being embarrassed of working out in front of others was a huge challenge. Learning about the different machines was also challenging. Nobody wants to look like they don't know what they are doing, so many people stick with the machines they know.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">A system that shows you which machines to use based on what you want to workout would be helpful. A friendlier atmosphere with fewer stigmas on working out would make the transition easier.</li>
			<img class="imgp3" src="img/IMA-251.jpg"/>
		</ul>
		<h3>Car to Bus Transportation</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="writingFont">Car driving was the beginning state. A middle state was being able to use the buses, but having to plan ahead of time. My end state is understanding and remembering the different options I have for different locations I commonly use.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">Not having to pay for gas or find parking in a city environment are the benefits of transitioning to the bus.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">Missing the bus was a big challenge. It was hard to know whether or not the bus had passed already and which bus would be the most efficient for getting to my destination on time. Learning all the bus option in my area was another challenging aspect.</li>
			<li class="writingFont">A phone application that helped keep track of where buses were and approximate when they would arrive would help me get to my destination on time better. A more improved and united version of the apps currently available would make everyday transportation much easier.</li>

			<h3>Wii U</h3>
			<img class="img4" src="img/9ynp-800.jpg"/>
			<p class="container para4">The Wii U is a gaming console that uses both digital and physical technology very well. Utilizing motion, touchscreen, and camera technology, the Wii U's gamepad is one of the most versatile gaming controllers on the market. It is used by gamers of all ages, with the primary audience being teenagers. Games are the digital content, with downloadable and disk games available. Physicallity exists in the controllers, allowing players to play the game with more physicality than just a thumbstick.</p>

			<h3>iPhone 6S</h3>
			<img class="img4" src="img/3D-Touch-Cydia-Tweak.jpg"/>
			<p class="container para4">3D touch is a very physical aspect of the brand new iPhone. Now the touch screen is more than just tapping. How hard you press on the phone's touchscreen will change how the phone reacts. This adds more of a physical way to interact with all the digital aspects of the phone. Various applications are the digital part of the phone, but the physical part belongs to the 3D touch.</p>

			<h3>New Crosswalk Button</h3>
			<img class="img4" src="img/buttons-with-feedback.jpg"/>
			<p class="container para4">Seattle has recently implemented new crosswalk systems in the more populated areas of the city. The digital aspect of the crosswalk has stayed the same, with an algorithim determining when the crosswalk is available. However, the button has changed to have more physical feedback. Sound and vibrating feedback occurs when the user pushes the button, allowing the user to know when their input is received. This creates a very necesarry physical feedback for people of all kinds.</p>

			<h3>Google Maps (phone directions)</h3>
			<img class="img4" src="img/maxresdefault.jpg"/>
			<p class="container para4">Google Maps has a very in depth digital part of its application. It has various algorithims to compute traffic and time, as well as a very complex representation of the map. Our position is very physical, and helps keep google up to date. Moving down the street or even turning the phone will update the digital display.</p>

			<h3>Oculus Rift</h3>
			<img class="img4" src="img/The-Oculus-Rift-headset-i-010.jpg"/>
			<p class="container para4">Virtual reality in gaming is the next big thing, and it is attempting to bridge the gap between our physical world and the digital world of the games. The universe that the game takes place is the digital aspect. How the Oculus Rift takes the users movement and turns are the physical part of the device. Users now feel as if they are actually in the game world, a very perfect example of physical and digital designs.</p>

		<h2>N + 1</h2>
		<p>Our team came up with the idea of making a physical practice PC. This practice PC would be purchased before buying PC or alongside one. With our practice PC, a user could attempt to put together a computer without risking breaking the actual expensive parts of the PC. Our immediate thought was cardboard, as it was easy to produce and very inexpensive. Ideally, the practice PC would be as cheap as possible, since most people would not want to spend too much money for such a simple product. The cardboard acheived this, but we didn't believe it actually acheived our goal. The material would be too flimsy and wouldn't replicate the actual building process.</p>
		<br></br>
		<p>After our initial design we decided to look at our other options. Plastic, metal, and paper mache were our options. Aluminum would be the most realistic representation of actual computer parts, but would be the most expensive and difficult to produce. Paper mache has very similar problems to cardboard and was we were very quick to write it off. Plastic was a perfect middle ground between cardboard and aluminum. This would be difficult to produce, but luckily Quinn and I work in Odegaard library. There are 3D printers and Quinn actually knew the person in charge of this, so we decided to go with 3D printed practice PC.</p>

		<h2>Participatory Design</h2>
		<p>Participatory Design is a great way for users to get involved in the design of projects. When making videos for my friends, I would love to hear their feedback on what they wanted to see from the video. Before starting it would be cool to get an idea of how they wanted certain projects to be.For a wireframe, I think a simple physical method of participatory design would be useful. Since target audiences aren't always very computer savvy, using a physical method to do participatory design would yield the best results. My idea would involve cutting out a lot of rectangles with varying sizes and dimensions. We would have a checklist for the content that would be needed on the actual pages, and let the users structure the site on their own. This way we could get a different perspectives on how the layout should look from non-designers. Users could write on the pieces of paper if they wanted to get more specific with the design. With writing they could demonstrate different structures like bullet points, tables, graphs, and more. </p>

			<p class="container">Our biggest decision was what transition our team wanted to focus on for the group project. We had the PC part picker, political candidate picker, and a improved bus app. We were very split on the subject, but we were all fine with whatever route was chosen. After deliberation, we decided to let the class choose what they thought was most interesting. The class voted and decided that the PC part picker was the most interesting topic. I personally thought that the political canddate picker has the most utility, but I compromised.

			<p class="container">Deciding how to implement a physical aspect to our group project was a difficult decision that our team had to make. Finding a physical way to help a user create a PC was difficult, but I came up with a practice PC that a user could have to build confidence. Choosing how to realistically implement this was very difficult. We could choose cardboard, paper mache, or plastic. After thinking about our resources we decided to learn how to 3D print and use that to create our physical model.

			<p class="container">Deciding what our transition would be specifically was a decision our group had to make. Many groups went with a "transition into the digital age" approach with their project, but we felt like a smaller scale transition was more appropriate. Our group decided that our goal was to help individuals transition from being computer illiterate to actually knowing the best way to build a computer. We stuck with an individual level because we all went through that transition ourselves.

		<!-- <h3>Political Candidate Picker</h3>
		<p>The Political Candidate Picker was my project for INFO 200, which was a reason why I didn't choose to do it in this class, but I am very passionate about the idea.  I actually believe that with a good team creating information for each politician, real change could be made. Media influence on every voter is too great. Most people vote for the candidate that gets the most air time, and don't actually look at the right reasons to elect officials. Many people I have talked to have loved the idea and I may pursue it in the future.
		<img class="imagesp10" src="img/politicalpicker.JPG"/>
		<h3>Better Bus System</h3>
		<p>The bus system is a huge part of my life, and is a huge problem everyday. The inconsistencies with the each route can cause me to be very early some days and late others. Since their are multiple buses to choose from in my area, I believe there needs to be a system that gives better information on which bus to take. Expanding on one bus away would be great</p>
		<img class="imagesp10" src="img/onebus.jpg"/>
		<h3>Silent Concert</h3>
		<p>This is less of a need and more of just a cool idea. An app that could create silent concerts and let others nearby listen to the same music at the same time would be awesome. I have never been to a silent concert before, but I can imagine how fun/funny it would be to particpate in this. It seems very implementable and something I want in the future</p>
		<img class="imagesp10" src="img/silent+disco+4.jpg"/>
		<h3>Assignment Crowd Source</h3>
		<p>Sometimes it is hard to choose a class without knowing what the content is. Whether it be the syllabus, the final project, or just a regular deliverable, being able to see the assignments before registering for a class would be invaluable. Having a file sharing site for classes would be a great way to get a taste of the class without going committing to the class. This would also allow people to get ahead and prepare for the class before it starts</p>
		<img class="imagesp10" src="img/assignments.JPG"/> -->
		<h3>Netflix</h3>
		<p>The design of Netflix is a huge part of it's success. It's website is visually attractive with it's dark background and simple images showing each show. The website scales well on smaller screens and the video player is efficient and extremely effective.</p>
		<img class="imagesp10" src="img/netflix.JPG"/>
		<h3>Reddit</h3>
		<p>Simple is better and Reddit proves this. There just isn't much going on, but the design is very smooth. With the RES extension, all the images and posts can be opened on the front page. The comment section is very simple and makes it easy to keep track of what thread you are on. 
		<img class="imagesp10" src="img/reddit.JPG"/>
		<h3>Twitch</h3>
		<p>Twitch theater mode is one of my favorite designs of a popular website. The theater mode keeps all the non-stream parts of the screen a darker color for easy viewing. It maximizes the screen size while keeping the chat on the side. It creates a large screen to view on, without going fullscreen. Being able to watch in windowed mode is great on it's own, and the overall color scheme is icing on the cake.</p>
		<img class="imagesp10" src="img/twitch.JPG"/>
		<h3>Gyazo</h3>
		<p>Gyazo is another example of simple being better. With gyazo, you open the program, drag over your desired area, and let go. This screen caps the highlighted area and sens the image directly to the gyazo server. The uploaded image opens automatically in the browser and the link is usable for anybody. It's a very efficient design, and the way the picture is layed out is great as well. You can click on the image to bring it to full size as well. Gyazo accomplishes all it's goals in a very simplistic way.</p>
		<img class="imagesp10" src="img/gyazo.JPG"/>

		<h2>Tools I've Learned</h2>
		<ol>
			<li class="list10">State Transition Diagrams</li>
			<p>I thought this was a very good idea for showing how sketches connect to each other and could be very useful in the design process.</p>
			<li class="list10">Contextual Task Analysis</li>
			<p>Actually viewing where a user is clicking and keeping track of this is better for quanitative data. Asking users questions is one thing, but having actualy numerical data is important.</p>
			<li class="list10">Project Planning</li>
			<p>Knowing your limitations and having an achievable plan is a big deal. Whether it being budget constraints, a time limit, or a resource limitation, being able to deal with it is huge.</p>
			<li class="list10">User Interviews</li>
			<p>Being able to ask the right questions and expand on what a user gives to you is a big part of the design process. I don't believe I've mastered it, but watching other people question the speakers in the class gave me good outside perspective of the practice.</p>
			<li class="list10">Ideation</li>
			<p>Ideation is a huge part of designing a program moving forward. Knowing how to design a product is one thing, but having an application people actually want is huge. Brainstorming was my favorite thing to do with my group, and I think our ideas were some of the better in the class</p>
